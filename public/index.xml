      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s another look at the data I used for my post on spatial Bayesian models! I made this value-by-alpha, or bivariate choropleth, map for my final map design project in Intro to Geographic Information Systems. Click the map to make it larger!

The idea of value-by-alpha is to replace a cartogram with variations in color rather than shape/size. These maps can be a little hard to interpret, but it was a fun design project and a neat way of looking at my data from a different perspective!</description>

I followed the work (and color schemes!) of Joshua Stevens. His tutorial uses QGIS but the same methods can be implemented easily in ArcMap.</description>

      <description>Note: This tutorial is closely related to my post on modelling birth control access using CARBayes. It was also written in collaboration with Katie Jolly! Here, we’ll help walk you through how to start an analysis of spatial data using the CARBayes package.
Introduction to spatial data Spatial data is everywhere. It can describe geography, demographics, epidemiology, and more. In fact, a lot of data we don’t always think of as spatial, such as voting records, can also be understood as describing variation across space.</description>

      <description>Building on the work in last week’s post, we can start fitting spatial Bayesian models to our data. We will use the CARBayes package to fit conditional autoregressive models which will better address the spatial autocorrelation in our data.
Conditional Autoregressive Models Spatial data violates one of the most basic assumptions in statistics: that our observations are independent of one another. This means that many of our familiar methods–Bayesian and frequentist!</description>

      <description>Last week, I fit an initial CARBayes model which identifies boundaries between counties in Tennessee. This week, I’ll explore some new models and decide which one(s) to present (and whether I want to fit the model to the entire country!).
Back up a second I’ve never actually tested to see if there is spatial autocorrelation in my data! I think we can see that there is, but we can check with Moran’s I to make sure we need to use spatial models.</description>

      <description>Birth control is a critical aspect of basic health care. Accessible contraceptive services have numerous tangible benefits from reducing teen pregnancy to lowering abortion rates. At the most basic level, birth control empowers women to navigate the world and their health more freely. The “pro-life” movement and current political climate put this vital resource at risk. With this in mind, I decided to study access to birth control in the United States.</description>

      <title>Spatial Bayesian Models of Contraceptive Deserts</title>

      <description>Spatial data violates one of the most basic assumptions in statistics: that our observations are independent of one another. This means that many of our familiar methods – Bayesian and frequentist! – aren’t useful in modelling spatial data. In this series of blog posts, Katie Jolly, Son Phan, and I will explore Bayesian methods to describe variation across space.
