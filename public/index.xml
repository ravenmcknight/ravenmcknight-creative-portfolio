      <description>Building on the work in last week’s post, we can start fitting spatial Bayesian models to our data. We will use the CARBayes package to fit conditional autoregressive models which will better address the spatial autocorrelation in our data.
Conditional Autoregressive Models Spatial data violates one of the most basic assumptions in statistics: that our observations are independent of one another. This means that many of our familiar methods–Bayesian and frequentist!</description>
